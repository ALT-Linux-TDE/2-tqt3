INSTALL
-------

Those man pages are not yet installed by 'make install'.
They have to be installed in $MANPATH/man1 and in $MANPATH/man3.
(See INSTALL in the top directory).

Example:
If qt3 has been installed in /usr/local and if MANPATH is
/usr/local/share/man, they can be installed with the following commands:
    install -m 644 man1/* /usr/local/share/man/man1
    install -m 644 man3/* /usr/local/share/man/man3
Change the commands to suit your needs.
