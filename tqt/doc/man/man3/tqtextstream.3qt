.SH DESCRIPTION
The QTextStream class provides basic functions for reading and writing text using a TQIODevice.
.PP
The text stream class has a functional interface that is very similar to that of the standard C++ iostream class.
.PP
Qt provides several global functions similar to the ones in iostream: <center>.nf
.TS
l - l. Function Meaning bin sets the QTextStream to read/write binary numbers oct sets the QTextStream to read/write octal numbers dec sets the QTextStream to read/write decimal numbers hex sets the QTextStream to read/write hexadecimal numbers endl forces a line break flush forces the TQIODevice to flush any buffered data ws eats any available whitespace (on input) reset resets the QTextStream to its default mode (see reset()) qSetW(int) sets the field width to the given argument qSetFill(int) sets the fill character to the given argument qSetPrecision(int)
.TE
.fi
</center>
.PP
\fBWarning:\fR By default QTextStream will automatically detect whether integers in the stream are in decimal, octal, hexadecimal or binary format when reading from the stream. In particular, a leading '0' signifies octal, i.e. the sequence "0100" will be interpreted as 64.
.PP
The QTextStream class reads and writes text; it is not appropriate for dealing with binary data (but QDataStream is).
.PP
By default, output of Unicode text (i.e. TQString) is done using the local 8-bit encoding. This can be changed using the setEncoding() method. For input, the QTextStream will auto-detect standard Unicode "byte order marked" text files; otherwise the local 8-bit encoding is used.
.PP
The TQIODevice is set in the constructor, or later using setDevice(). If the end of the input is reached atEnd() returns TRUE. Data can be read into variables of the appropriate type using the operator>>() overloads, or read in its entirety into a single string using read(), or read a line at a time using readLine(). Whitespace can be skipped over using skipWhiteSpace(). You can set flags for the stream using flags() or setf(). The stream also supports width(), precision() and fill(); use reset() to reset the defaults.
.PP

.SH MEMBER FUNCTION DOCUMENTATION
.SH "QTextStream::QTextStream ()"
Constructs a data stream that has no IO device.
.SH "QTextStream::QTextStream ( TQIODevice * iod )"
Constructs a text stream that uses the IO device \fIiod\fR.
.SH "QTextStream::QTextStream ( TQString * str, int filemode )"
Constructs a text stream that operates on the Unicode TQString, \fIstr\fR, through an internal device. The \fIfilemode\fR argument is passed to the device's open() function; see TQIODevice::mode().
.PP
If you set an encoding or codec with setEncoding() or setCodec(), this setting is ignored for text streams that operate on TQString.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.nf
.br
    TQString str;
.br
    QTextStream ts( &str, IO_WriteOnly );
.br
    ts << "pi = " << 3.14; // str == "pi = 3.14"
.br
.fi
.PP
Writing data to the text stream will modify the contents of the string. The string will be expanded when data is written beyond the end of the string. Note that the string will not be truncated:
.PP
.nf
.br
    TQString str = "pi = 3.14";
.br
    QTextStream ts( &str, IO_WriteOnly );
.br
    ts <<  "2+2 = " << 2+2; // str == "2+2 = 414"
.br
.fi
.PP
Note that because TQString is Unicode, you should not use readRawBytes() or writeRawBytes() on such a stream.
.SH "QTextStream::QTextStream ( TQString & str, int filemode )"
\fBThis function is obsolete.\fR It is provided to keep old source working. We strongly advise against using it in new code.
.PP
This constructor is equivalent to the constructor taking a TQString* parameter.
.SH "QTextStream::QTextStream ( QByteArray a, int mode )"
Constructs a text stream that operates on the byte array, \fIa\fR, through an internal QBuffer device. The \fImode\fR argument is passed to the device's open() function; see TQIODevice::mode().
.PP
Example:
.PP
.nf
.br
    QByteArray array;
.br
    QTextStream ts( array, IO_WriteOnly );
.br
    ts << "pi = " << 3.14 << '\\0'; // array == "pi = 3.14"
.br
.fi
.PP
Writing data to the text stream will modify the contents of the array. The array will be expanded when data is written beyond the end of the string.
.PP
Same example, using a QBuffer:
.PP
.nf
.br
    QByteArray array;
.br
    QBuffer buf( array );
.br
    buf.open( IO_WriteOnly );
.br
    QTextStream ts( &buf );
.br
    ts << "pi = " << 3.14 << '\\0'; // array == "pi = 3.14"
.br
    buf.close();
.br
.fi
.SH "QTextStream::QTextStream ( FILE * fh, int mode )"
Constructs a text stream that operates on an existing file handle \fIfh\fR through an internal QFile device. The \fImode\fR argument is passed to the device's open() function; see TQIODevice::mode().
.PP
Note that if you create a QTextStream \fCcout\fR or another name that is also used for another variable of a different type, some linkers may confuse the two variables, which will often cause crashes.
.SH "QTextStream::~QTextStream ()\fC [virtual]\fR"
Destroys the text stream.
.PP
The destructor does not affect the current IO device.
.SH "bool QTextStream::atEnd () const"
Returns TRUE if the IO device has reached the end position (end of the stream or file) or if there is no IO device set; otherwise returns FALSE.
.PP
See also TQIODevice::atEnd().
.PP
Examples:
.)l addressbook/centralwidget.cpp and grapher/grapher.cpp.
.SH "QTextCodec * QTextStream::codec ()"
Returns the codec actually used for this stream.
.PP
If Unicode is automatically detected in input, a codec with name() "ISO-10646-UCS-2" is returned.
.PP
See also setCodec().
.SH "TQIODevice * QTextStream::device () const"
Returns the IO device currently set.
.PP
See also setDevice() and unsetDevice().
.SH "bool QTextStream::eof () const"
\fBThis function is obsolete.\fR It is provided to keep old source working. We strongly advise against using it in new code.
.PP
This function has been renamed to atEnd().
.PP
See also TQIODevice::atEnd().
.PP
Example: chart/chartform_files.cpp.
.SH "int QTextStream::fill () const"
Returns the fill character. The default value is ' ' (space).
.SH "int QTextStream::fill ( int f )"
This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It behaves essentially like the above function.
.PP
Sets the fill character to \fIf\fR. Returns the previous fill character.
.SH "int QTextStream::flags () const"
Returns the current stream flags. The default value is 0.
.PP

Resets the text stream.
.TP

.PP
See also setf(), width(), fill(), and precision().

See also device() and unsetDevice().
.SH "void QTextStream::setEncoding ( Encoding e )"
Sets the encoding of this stream to \fIe\fR, where \fIe\fR is one of the following values: <center>.nf
.TS
l - l. Encoding Meaning Locale Uses local file format (Latin1 if locale is not set), but autodetecting Unicode(utf16) on input. Unicode Uses Unicode(utf16) for input and output. Output will be written in the order most efficient for the current platform (i.e. the order used internally in TQString). UnicodeUTF8 Using Unicode(utf8) for input and output. If you use it for input it will autodetect utf16 and use it instead of utf8. Latin1 ISO-8859-1. Will not autodetect utf16. UnicodeNetworkOrder Uses network order Unicode(utf16) for input and output. Useful when reading Unicode data that does not start with the byte order marker. UnicodeReverse Uses reverse network order Unicode(utf16) for input and output. Useful when reading Unicode data that does not start with the byte order marker or when writing data that should be read by buggy Windows applications. RawUnicode
.TE
.fi
</center>
.PP
Locale and all Unicode encodings, except RawUnicode, will look at the first two bytes in an input stream to determine the byte order. The initial byte order marker will be stripped off before data is read.
.PP
Note that this function should be called before any data is read to or written from the stream.
.PP
See also setCodec().
.PP

.)l addressbook/centralwidget.cpp, network/httpd/httpd.cpp, and qwerty/qwerty.cpp.

.PP
