tqembed \- Converts arbitrary files into C++ code.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
The TQEmbed tool, found in tqt3/tools/qembed, converts
arbitrary files into C++ code. This is useful for
including image files and other resources directly into
your application rather than loading the data from
external files. 

TQEmbed can also generate uncompressed versions of images
that can be included directly into your application,
thus avoiding both the external file and the need to
parse the image file format. This is useful for small
images such as icons for which compression is not a
great gain.
