.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 

Extracts information about text to be translated. It
recognizes the tr() constructs described above and
produces a file in ".po" format, a simple text format
that your translation team will copy and edit. For
example, the base .po file might be myapp.po and
translated versions of the file would then be
myapp_de.po, myapp_fr.po, and myapp_ja.po for
translations in German, French and Japanese respectively.

  tqtfindtr *.cpp *.h >myapp.po
  copy myapp.po myapp_de.po
  edit myapp_de.po
