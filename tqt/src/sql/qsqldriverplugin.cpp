    \class TQSqlDriverPlugin ntqsqldriverplugin.h
    \brief The TQSqlDriverPlugin class provides an abstract base for custom TQSqlDriver plugins.

    \ingroup plugins
    \mainclass

    The SQL driver plugin is a simple plugin interface that makes it
    easy to create your own SQL driver plugins that can be loaded
    dynamically by TQt.

    Writing a SQL plugin is achieved by subclassing this base class,
    reimplementing the pure virtual functions keys() and create(), and
    exporting the class with the \c Q_EXPORT_PLUGIN macro. See the SQL
    plugins that come with TQt for example implementations (in the
    \c{plugins/src/sqldrivers} subdirectory of the source
    distribution). Read the \link plugins-howto.html plugins
    documentation\endlink for more information on plugins.

/*!
    \fn TQStringList TQSqlDriverPlugin::keys() const

    Returns the list of drivers (keys) this plugin supports.

    These keys are usually the class names of the custom drivers that
    are implemented in the plugin.

/*!
    \fn TQSqlDriver* TQSqlDriverPlugin::create( const TQString& key )

    Creates and returns a TQSqlDriver object for the driver key \a key.
    The driver key is usually the class name of the required driver.
