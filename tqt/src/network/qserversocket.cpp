    \brief The TQServerSocket class provides a TCP-based server.
\if defined(commercial)
    It is part of the <a href="commercialeditions.html">TQt Enterprise Edition</a>.

    \ingroup io
    \module network

    This class is a convenience class for accepting incoming TCP
    connections. You can specify the port or have TQServerSocket pick
    one, and listen on just one address or on all the machine's
    addresses.

    Using the API is very simple: subclass TQServerSocket, call the
    constructor of your choice, and implement newConnection() to
    handle new incoming connections. There is nothing more to do.

    (Note that due to lack of support in the underlying APIs,
    TQServerSocket cannot accept or reject connections conditionally.)

    on all the addresses of this host. If \a port is 0, TQServerSocket
    will pick a suitable port in a system-dependent manner. Use \a
    backlog to specify how many pending connections the server can
    have.

    The \a parent and \a name arguments are passed on to the TQObject
    constructor.

    \warning On Tru64 Unix systems a value of 0 for \a backlog means
    that you don't accept any connections at all; you should specify a
