    \class TQPrinter ntqprinter.h
    \brief The TQPrinter class is a paint device that paints on a printer.

    \ingroup images
    \ingroup graphics
    \mainclass

    On Windows it uses the built-in printer drivers. On X11 it
    generates postscript and sends that to lpr, lp, or another print
    command.

    TQPrinter is used in much the same way as TQWidget and TQPixmap are
    used. The big difference is that you must keep track of the pages.

    TQPrinter supports a number of settable parameters, most of which
    can be changed by the end user when the application calls
    TQPrinter::setup().

    The most important parameters are:
    \list
    \i setOrientation() tells TQPrinter which page orientation to use (virtual).
    \i setPageSize() tells TQPrinter what page size to expect from the
    printer.
    \i setResolution() tells TQPrinter what resolution you wish the
    printer to provide (in dpi).
    \i setFullPage() tells TQPrinter whether you want to deal with the
    full page or just with the part the printer can draw on. The
    default is FALSE, so that by default you should be able to paint
    on (0,0). If TRUE the origin of the coordinate system will be in
    the top left corner of the paper and most probably the printer
    will not be able to paint something there due to it's physical
    margins.
    \i setNumCopies() tells TQPrinter how many copies of the document
    it should print.
    \i setMinMax() tells TQPrinter and TQPrintDialog what the allowed
    range for fromPage() and toPage() are.
    \endlist

    Except where noted, you can only call the set functions before
    setup(), or between TQPainter::end() and setup(). (Some may take
    effect between setup() and begin(), or between begin() and end(),
    but that's strictly undocumented and such behaviour may differ
    depending on platform.)

    There are also some settings that the user sets (through the
    printer dialog) and that applications are expected to obey:

    \list

    \i pageOrder() tells the application program whether to print
    first-page-first or last-page-first.

    \i colorMode() tells the application program whether to print in
    color or grayscale. (If you print in color and the printer does
    not support color, TQt will try to approximate. The document may
    take longer to print, but the quality should not be made visibly
    poorer.)

    \i fromPage() and toPage() indicate what pages the application
    program should print.

    \i paperSource() tells the application progam which paper source
    to print from.

    \endlist

    You can of course call these functions to establish defaults
    before you ask the user through TQPrinter::setup().

    Once you start printing, calling newPage() is essential. You will
    probably also need to look at the TQPaintDeviceMetrics for the
    printer (see the \link simple-application.html#printersimple print
    function\endlink in the Application walk-through). In previous versions,
    paint device metrics were valid only after the TQPrinter has been set
    up, i.e. after setup() has returned successfully. This is no longer
    the case and paint device metrics can be requested safely before set up.

    If you want to abort the print job, abort() will try its best to
    stop printing. It may cancel the entire job or just some of it.

    \omit Need a function to setup() without a dialog (i.e. use defaults).

/*!
    \enum TQPrinter::PrinterMode

    This enum describes the mode the printer should work in. It
    basically presets a certain resolution and working mode.

    \value ScreenResolution Sets the resolution of the print device to
    the screen resolution. This has the big advantage that the results
    obtained when painting on the printer will match more or less
    exactly the visible output on the screen. It is the easiest to
    use, as font metrics on the screen and on the printer are the
    same. This is the default value. ScreenResolution will produce a
    lower quality output than HighResolution and should only be used
    for drafts.

    \value PrinterResolution Use the physical resolution of the
    printer on Windows. On Unix, set the postscript resolution to 72
    dpi.

    \value HighResolution Use printer resolution on windows, set the
    resolution of the postscript driver to 600dpi.

    \value Compatible Almost the same as PrinterResolution, but keeps
    some peculiarities of the TQt 2.x printer driver. This is useful
    for applications ported from TQt 2.x to TQt 3.x.
*/

/*!
    \enum TQPrinter::Orientation

    This enum type (not to be confused with TQt::Orientation) is used
    to specify each page's orientation.

    \value Portrait the page's height is greater than its width (the
    default).

    \value Landscape the page's width is greater than its height.

    This type interacts with \l TQPrinter::PageSize and
    TQPrinter::setFullPage() to determine the final size of the page
    available to the application.
*/


/*!
    \enum TQPrinter::PageSize

    This enum type specifies what paper size TQPrinter should use.
    TQPrinter does not check that the paper size is available; it just
    uses this information, together with TQPrinter::Orientation and
    TQPrinter::setFullPage(), to determine the printable area (see
    TQPaintDeviceMetrics).

    The defined sizes (with setFullPage(TRUE)) are:

    \value A0 841 x 1189 mm This value is not supported on windows.
    \value A1 594 x 841 mm This value is not supported on windows.
    \value A2 420 x 594 mm
    \value A3 297 x 420 mm
    \value A4 210 x 297 mm, 8.26 x 11.7 inches
    \value A5 148 x 210 mm
    \value A6 105 x 148 mm
    \value A7 74 x 105 mm
    \value A8 52 x 74 mm
    \value A9 37 x 52 mm
    \value B0 1030 x 1456 mm
    \value B1 728 x 1030 mm
    \value B10 32 x 45 mm

    \value B3 364 x 515 mm
    \value B4 257 x 364 mm

    \value B7 91 x 128 mm
    \value B8 64 x 91 mm
    \value B9 45 x 64 mm
    \value C5E 163 x 229 mm
    \value Comm10E 105 x 241 mm, US Common #10 Envelope
    \value DLE 110 x 220 mm
    \value Executive 7.5 x 10 inches, 191 x 254 mm
    \value Folio 210 x 330 mm
    \value Ledger 432 x 279 mm
    \value Legal 8.5 x 14 inches, 216 x 356 mm
    \value Letter 8.5 x 11 inches, 216 x 279 mm
    \value Tabloid 279 x 432 mm
    \value Custom
    \value NPageSize (internal)

    With setFullPage(FALSE) (the default), the metrics will be a bit
    smaller; how much depends on the printer in use.
*/


/*!
    \enum TQPrinter::PageOrder

    This enum type is used by TQPrinter to tell the application program
    how to print.

    \value FirstPageFirst  the lowest-numbered page should be printed
    first.

    \value LastPageFirst  the highest-numbered page should be printed
    first.
*/

/*!
    \enum TQPrinter::ColorMode

    This enum type is used to indicate whether TQPrinter should print
    in color or not.

    \value Color  print in color if available, otherwise in grayscale.

    \value GrayScale  print in grayscale, even on color printers.
    Might be a little faster than \c Color. This is the default.
*/

/*!
    \enum TQPrinter::PaperSource

    This enum type specifies what paper source TQPrinter is to use.
    TQPrinter does not check that the paper source is available; it
    just uses this information to try and set the paper source.
    Whether it will set the paper source depends on whether the
    printer has that particular source.

    Note: this is currently only implemented for Windows.

  should use to print.

  \value Selection Only the selection should be printed.
  \value PageRange From page, to page option.

  \sa setPrintRange(), printRange()
*/

/*!
  \enum TQPrinter::PrinterOption

  This enum describes various printer options that appear in the
  printer setup dialog. It is used to enable and disable these
  options in the setup dialog.

  \value PrintToFile Describes if print to file should be enabled.
  \value PrintSelection Describes if printing selections should be enabled.
