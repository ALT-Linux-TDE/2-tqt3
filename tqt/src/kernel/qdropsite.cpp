  \class TQDropSite ntqdropsite.h
  \brief The TQDropSite class provides nothing and does nothing.

  \obsolete

  If your code uses it, you can safely delete it.

  It was used in TQt 1.x to do some drag and drop; that has since been
  folded into TQWidget.

  For detailed information about drag-and-drop, see the TQDragObject class.

  \sa TQDragObject, TQTextDrag, TQImageDrag

/*!
  Constructs a TQDropSite to handle events for the widget \a self.

  Pass \c this as the \a self parameter.
  This enables dropping by calling TQWidget::setAcceptDrops(TRUE).
