    \class TQNetworkProtocol ntqnetworkprotocol.h
    \brief The TQNetworkProtocol class provides a common API for network protocols.
\if defined(commercial)
    It is part of the <a href="commercialeditions.html">TQt Enterprise Edition</a>.
\endif

    \module network
    \ingroup io
    \module network
    \mainclass

    This is a base class which should be used for network protocols
    implementations that can then be used in TQt (e.g. in the file
    dialog) together with the TQUrlOperator.

    The easiest way to implement a new network protocol is to
    reimplement the operation*() methods, e.g. operationGet(), etc.
    Only the supported operations should be reimplemented. To specify
    which operations are supported, also reimplement
    supportedOperations() and return an int that is OR'd together
    using the supported operations from the \l
    TQNetworkProtocol::Operation enum.

    When you implement a network protocol this way, it is important to
    emit the correct signals. Also, always emit the finished() signal
    when an operation is done (on success \e and on failure). TQt
    relies on correctly emitted finished() signals.

    For a detailed description of the TQt Network Architecture and how
    to implement and use network protocols in TQt, see the \link
    network.html TQt Network Documentation\endlink.
*/

/*!
    \fn void TQNetworkProtocol::newChildren( const TQValueList<TQUrlInfo> &i, TQNetworkOperation *op )

    This signal is emitted after listChildren() was called and new
    children (files) have been read from the list of files. \a i holds
    the information about the new children. \a op is the pointer to
    the operation object which contains all the information about the
    operation, including the state, etc.

    When a protocol emits this signal, TQNetworkProtocol is smart
    enough to let the TQUrlOperator, which is used by the network
    protocol, emit its corresponding signal.

    When implementing your own network protocol and reading children,
    you usually don't read one child at once, but rather a list of
    them. That's why this signal takes a list of TQUrlInfo objects. If
    you prefer to read just one child at a time you can use the
    convenience signal newChild(), which takes a single TQUrlInfo
    object.
*/

/*!
    \fn void TQNetworkProtocol::newChild( const TQUrlInfo &i, TQNetworkOperation *op )

    This signal is emitted if a new child (file) has been read.
    TQNetworkProtocol automatically connects it to a slot which creates
    a list of TQUrlInfo objects (with just one TQUrlInfo \a i) and emits
    the newChildren() signal with this list. \a op is the pointer to
    the operation object which contains all the information about the
    operation that has finished, including the state, etc.

    This is just a convenience signal useful for implementing your own
    network protocol. In all other cases connect to the newChildren()
    signal with its list of TQUrlInfo objects.
*/

/*!
    \fn void TQNetworkProtocol::finished( TQNetworkOperation *op )

    This signal is emitted when an operation finishes. This signal is
    always emitted, for both success and failure. \a op is the pointer
    to the operation object which contains all the information about
    the operation, including the state, etc. Check the state and error
    code of the operation object to determine whether or not the
    operation was successful.

    When a protocol emits this signal, TQNetworkProtocol is smart
    enough to let the TQUrlOperator, which is used by the network
    protocol, emit its corresponding signal.
*/

/*!
    \fn void TQNetworkProtocol::start( TQNetworkOperation *op )

    Some operations (such as listChildren()) emit this signal when
    they start processing the operation. \a op is the pointer to the
    operation object which contains all the information about the
    operation, including the state, etc.

    When a protocol emits this signal, TQNetworkProtocol is smart
    enough to let the TQUrlOperator, which is used by the network
    protocol, emit its corresponding signal.
*/

/*!
    \fn void TQNetworkProtocol::createdDirectory( const TQUrlInfo &i, TQNetworkOperation *op )

    This signal is emitted when mkdir() has been succesful and the
    directory has been created. \a i holds the information about the
    new directory. \a op is the pointer to the operation object which
    contains all the information about the operation, including the
    state, etc. Using op->arg( 0 ), you can get the file name of the
    new directory.

    When a protocol emits this signal, TQNetworkProtocol is smart
    enough to let the TQUrlOperator, which is used by the network
    protocol, emit its corresponding signal.
*/

/*!
    \fn void TQNetworkProtocol::removed( TQNetworkOperation *op )

    This signal is emitted when remove() has been succesful and the
    file has been removed. \a op holds the file name of the removed
    file in the first argument, accessible with op->arg( 0 ). \a op is
    the pointer to the operation object which contains all the
    information about the operation, including the state, etc.

    When a protocol emits this signal, TQNetworkProtocol is smart
    enough to let the TQUrlOperator, which is used by the network
    protocol, emit its corresponding signal.
*/

/*!
    \fn void TQNetworkProtocol::itemChanged( TQNetworkOperation *op )

    This signal is emitted whenever a file which is a child of this
    URL has been changed, e.g. by successfully calling rename(). \a op
    holds the original and the new file names in the first and second
    arguments, accessible with op->arg( 0 ) and op->arg( 1 )
    respectively. \a op is the pointer to the operation object which
    contains all the information about the operation, including the
    state, etc.

    When a protocol emits this signal, TQNetworkProtocol is smart
    enough to let the TQUrlOperator, which is used by the network
    protocol, emit its corresponding signal.
*/

/*!
    \fn void TQNetworkProtocol::data( const TQByteArray &data,
    TQNetworkOperation *op )

    This signal is emitted when new \a data has been received after
    calling get() or put(). \a op holds the name of the file from
    which data is retrieved or uploaded in its first argument, and the
    (raw) data in its second argument. You can get them with
    op->arg( 0 ) and op->rawArg( 1 ). \a op is the pointer to the
    operation object, which contains all the information about the
    operation, including the state, etc.

    When a protocol emits this signal, TQNetworkProtocol is smart
    enough to let the TQUrlOperator (which is used by the network
    protocol) emit its corresponding signal.
*/

/*!
    \fn void TQNetworkProtocol::dataTransferProgress( int bytesDone, int bytesTotal, TQNetworkOperation *op )

    This signal is emitted during the transfer of data (using put() or
    get()). \a bytesDone is how many bytes of \a bytesTotal have been
    transferred. \a bytesTotal may be -1, which means that the total
    number of bytes is not known. \a op is the pointer to the
    operation object which contains all the information about the
    operation, including the state, etc.

    When a protocol emits this signal, TQNetworkProtocol is smart
    enough to let the TQUrlOperator, which is used by the network
    protocol, emit its corresponding signal.
*/

/*!
    \fn void TQNetworkProtocol::connectionStateChanged( int state, const TQString &data )

    This signal is emitted whenever the state of the connection of the
    network protocol is changed. \a state describes the new state,
    which is one of, \c ConHostFound, \c ConConnected or \c ConClosed.
    \a data is a message text.
*/

/*!
    \enum TQNetworkProtocol::State

    This enum contains the state that a TQNetworkOperation can have.

    \value StWaiting  The operation is in the TQNetworkProtocol's queue
    waiting to be prcessed.

    \value StInProgress  The operation is being processed.

    \value StDone  The operation has been processed succesfully.

    \value StFailed  The operation has been processed but an error occurred.

    \value StStopped  The operation has been processed but has been
    stopped before it finished, and is waiting to be processed.

*/

/*!
    \enum TQNetworkProtocol::Operation

    This enum lists the possible operations that a network protocol
    can support. supportedOperations() returns an int of these that is
    OR'd together. Also, the type() of a TQNetworkOperation is always
    one of these values.

    \value OpListChildren  List the children of a URL, e.g. of a directory.
    \value OpMkDir  Create a directory.
    \value OpRemove  Remove a child (e.g. a file).
    \value OpRename  Rename a child (e.g. a file).
    \value OpGet  Get data from a location.
    \value OpPut  Put data to a location.
*/

/*!
    \enum TQNetworkProtocol::ConnectionState

    When the connection state of a network protocol changes it emits
    the signal connectionStateChanged(). The first argument is one of
    the following values:

    \value ConHostFound  Host has been found.
    \value ConConnected  Connection to the host has been established.
    \value ConClosed  Connection has been closed.
*/

/*!
    \enum TQNetworkProtocol::Error

    When an operation fails (finishes unsuccessfully), the
    TQNetworkOperation of the operation returns an error code which has
    one of the following values:

    \value NoError  No error occurred.

    \value ErrValid  The URL you are operating on is not valid.

    \value ErrUnknownProtocol  There is no protocol implementation
    available for the protocol of the URL you are operating on (e.g.
    if the protocol is http and no http implementation has been
    registered).

    \value ErrUnsupported  The operation is not supported by the
    protocol.

    \value ErrParse  The URL could not be parsed correctly.

    \value ErrLoginIncorrect  You needed to login but the username
    or password is wrong.

    \value ErrHostNotFound  The specified host (in the URL) couldn't
    be found.

    \value ErrListChildren  An error occurred while listing the
    children (files).

    \value ErrMkDir  An error occurred when creating a directory.

    \value ErrRemove  An error occurred when removing a child (file).

    \value ErrRename   An error occurred when renaming a child (file).

    \value ErrGet  An error occurred while getting (retrieving) data.

    \value ErrPut  An error occurred while putting (uploading) data.

    \value ErrFileNotExisting  A file which is needed by the operation
    doesn't exist.

    \value ErrPermissionDenied  Permission for doing the operation has
    been denied.

    You should also use these error codes when implementing custom
    network protocols. If this is not possible, you can define your own
    error codes by using integer values that don't conflict with any
    of these values.
