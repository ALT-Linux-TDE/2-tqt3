    This function may be overridden only if input method is depending
    on X11 and you need raw XEvent. Otherwise, this function must not.

    This function is designed to filter raw key events for XIM, but
    other input methods may use this to implement some special
    features such as distinguishing Shift_L and Shift_R.

    Return TRUE if the \a event has been consumed. Otherwise, the
    unfiltered \a event will be translated into TQEvent and forwarded
    to filterEvent(). Filtering at both x11FilterEvent() and
    filterEvent() in single input method is allowed.

    \a keywidget is a client widget into which a text is inputted. \a
    event is inputted XEvent.
