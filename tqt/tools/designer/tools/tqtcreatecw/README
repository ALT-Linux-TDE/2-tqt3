This small application makes it much easier to create custom widget
descriptions for TQt Designer. Using them you can use custom widgets
in TQt Designer including their signals, slots and properties. 

The usual way to do this is to enter all the information in the custom
widget dialog in TQt Designer for each widget. But this small tool can
create these description files for your custom widgets which you then
can simply import into TQt Designer. So you can use your custom widgets
without any additional work in your forms in TQt Designer.

To do this you must modify the sourcecode (main.cpp) a bit and
recompile it afterwards. For further instructions how to use it see
the comments starting with STEP1 and STEP2 in main.cpp.

Note that TQt Designer now supports widget plugins which are more
versatile and work just like built-in widgets, so you may prefer to
make your custom widgets into plugins. See the designer manual for
more information.
