    \title TQt Distribution Example

    This example program modifies the hard-coded paths that are
    compiled into the TQt library.

    When distributing the TQt library, the final installation prefix is
    very rarely the same as the prefix used when doing development.
    You can use the code from this example to modify the following
    hard-coded paths in TQt library:

    \list

    \i Prefix - Normally, all other paths are relative to the \e
    Prefix.

    \i Binaries - Location of binaries distributed with TQt (for
    example, \e{Qt Assistant}).

    \i Documentation - Location of the TQt documentation.

    \i Headers - Location of the TQt headers.

    \i Libraries - Location of addition libraries distributed with Qt
    (for example, the \e tqui library).

    \i Plugins - Location of the TQt plugins.

    \i Data - Location of applicaton specific data for all programs
    distributed with Qt.
