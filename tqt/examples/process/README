The process example is not particularly useful, but it shows a typical
use of the class QProcess.

This example starts the uic command with some options and displays the
output of the uic call. The uic is a command line tool that is used if you
create dialogs with the TQt Designer. If you installed TQt correctly, it
should be available on your system. It outputs the generated code to
standard output by default.
