This is TQt version 3.5.0.

TQt is a multiplatform C++ GUI application framework based on the last open source release of Qt 3.x branch which is maintained by the Trinity Desktop project.


Why?
----

TQt strives to be a lightweight toolkit for developing graphical desktop applications based on the Window-Icon-Menu-Pointer model.

Compared to Qt, which has become a framework with lots of features not necessarily related to desktop computing, resulting in unnecessary bloat, TQt strives for a different approach by avoiding feature creep and unnecessary complexity.
