Qt 3.5 is a new feature release. It is not backwards compatible with any
prior TQt3 version due to changes in the QStyle API.

General Improvements

    * Modify TQStyle API to work without requiring direct access to Qt-specific objects
      See "TQStyle API Change" section below

TQStyle API Change
---------------------

The following style function definitions have changed:

drawPrimitive
drawControl
drawControlMask
subRect
drawComplexControl
drawComplexControlMask
querySubControlMetrics
querySubControl
pixelMetric
sizeFromContents
styleHint
stylePixmap
visualRect
drawTDEStylePrimitive
polish
unPolish

The following new functions have been added:
applicationPolish
applicationUnPolish
installObjectEventHandler
removeObjectEventHandler
objectEventHandler
widgetActionRequest

Additionally, SH_UnderlineAccelerator has been extended with a new style hint, SH_HideUnderlineAcceleratorWhenAltUp

Porting an existing style to the new API is relatively straightforward; simply update the function definitions in the existing style with the new definition prototypes and cast the passed pointer to TQWidget or TQObject where appropriate.
